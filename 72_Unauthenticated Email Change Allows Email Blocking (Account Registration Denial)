The application allows users to change their account email address without any verification (no confirmation email or OTP),As a result, a user can update their account email to any arbitrary email address, even one they do not own.
This causes a denial-of-service against legitimate users, because the real owner of that email address is later blocked from registering, as the system reports that the email already exists.



                                                                                Steps to Reproduce



1.Create a new account and log in normally.
2.Navigate to Account Settings.
3.Change the email address to any arbitrary email, for example: randomuser123@example.com
4.Save the changes.

5.Observe that: No verification email is sent
              No OTP or confirmation is required
              The email change is accepted immediately

6.Log out.
7.Attempt to register a new account using: randomuser123@example.com
8.Observe the error message: "Email already exists"

➡️ This confirms that the email was claimed without ownership verification.

An attacker can: Claim email addresses they do not own
                 Prevent legitimate users from registering
                 Abuse popular or targeted email addresses
                  Cause denial-of-service against user onboarding
                  Damage user trust and platform reputation

Require email verification for all email address changes
Send a confirmation link or OTP to the new email
Apply the email change only after verification
Mark unverified emails as pending
Allow registration attempts for emails not yet verified
Log and monitor suspicious email change activity
