The application sends password reset links over an unsecured HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS.
Because HTTP traffic is not encrypted, attackers positioned on the network (e.g., public Wi-Fi, ISP, or man-in-the-middle) can intercept the reset link and take over user accounts.


                                                                              
                                                                                 Steps to Reproduce



1.Navigate to the Forgot Password page of the website.

2.Enter a registered email address and submit the request.

3.Check the email inbox for the password reset email.

4.Open the email and locate the password reset link.

5.Copy the reset link URL.

6.Paste the URL into a text editor.

7.Observe the protocol used at the beginning of the link.

🔎 Observation :
The password reset link starts with: http://
instead of: https://


➡️ This confirms the vulnerability.

An attacker can: Intercept password reset links via MITM attacks
                  Reset user passwords without authorization
                 Take full control of user accounts
                 Access sensitive personal or financial data
                 Compromise multiple users on shared networks
                   Damage user trust and brand reputation


                  
                                                                                    Remediation




Enforce HTTPS across the entire application
Generate password reset links using HTTPS only
Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

Use secure cookies with: Secure
                          HttpOnly

Invalidate reset tokens after: One use
                             Short expiration time

Regularly audit email templates and links
