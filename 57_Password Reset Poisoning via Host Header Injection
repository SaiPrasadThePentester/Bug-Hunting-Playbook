The application generates password reset links using the Host header from incoming HTTP requests without proper validation.
If an attacker manipulates this header, the application may embed an attacker-controlled domain into password reset emails.
This can result in password reset poisoning, where reset tokens are delivered to a third-party domain, enabling account takeover if a victim interacts with the email.



                                                                               
                                                                                 Steps to Reproduce



Navigate to the application’s Forgot Password page.
Enter a valid registered email address and submit the password reset request.
Intercept the password reset request using an HTTP interception proxy (e.g., Burp Suite).
Observe that the request includes a Host header which is used by the application to construct the password reset URL.
Modify the Host header value to a non-standard or untrusted domain (for testing purposes).
Forward the modified request to the server.
Check the received password reset email for the submitted account.
Observe that the password reset link contains the modified Host value instead of the legitimate application domain.
This confirms that the application trusts user-supplied Host headers when generating password reset links.

➡️ Vulnerability confirmed: Password reset link generation relies on unvalidated Host headers.  


#Advance Level  Exploitation: Use Burp Collaborator, When the victim clicked it, the reset token was exfiltrated directly to me.

An attacker could: Hijack password reset flows
                    Capture password reset tokens
                     Reset user passwords
                    Take over accounts completely
                    Access sensitive personal or financial data
                   Damage user trust and platform reputation



                                                                                     Remediation
 


Do not trust the Host header for security-sensitive URL generation
Use a hardcoded, allow-listed base URL for password reset links
Validate the Host header against an approved domain list

Bind reset tokens to: Correct domain
                      User identity

Enforce short token expiration

Invalidate tokens after: One use
                        Email or password change

Add user notifications for password reset events
Monitor for abnormal reset behavior
