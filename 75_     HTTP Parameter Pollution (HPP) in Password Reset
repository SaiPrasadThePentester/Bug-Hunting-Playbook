The password reset functionality is vulnerable to HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP).
By supplying multiple email parameters in a single password reset request, the application processes more than one email address instead of enforcing a single target account.
As a result, password reset links are sent to multiple users, and resetting the password using one link affects multiple accounts, leading to mass account takeover.                                                                                   Steps To Reproduce

•	Go to Forgot Password 
•	Enter a valid email and submit
•	Intercept the request using Burp Suite

•	Modify the request parameters as follows:
 POST /forgot-password
email=user1@test.com&email=user2@test.com

•	Forward the request
•	Observe that password reset links are sent to both email accounts
•	Open the reset link received for Account 1
•	Change the password
•	Attempt login to Account 2
•	Observe that Account 2 password is also changed

An attacker can: Reset passwords for multiple users at once
                Perform mass account takeover
                Bypass authentication controls
                Disrupt user access (DoS)
               Cause severe reputational and financial damage


                                                                                 Remediation

Reject duplicate parameters in HTTP requests
Enforce strict input validation (one email per request)
Normalize and validate parameters server-side
Bind password reset tokens to a single user ID
Add rate-limiting on password reset requests
Log and alert on abnormal parameter patterns
