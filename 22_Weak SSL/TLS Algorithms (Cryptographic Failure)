Weak or insecure SSL/TLS algorithms can expose encrypted communication to attacks such as downgrade attacks, data interception, or cryptographic breaks. To identify such issues, automated SSL/TLS analysis was performed.

                                          
                                                                                    
                                                                                           Tool Setup & Usage


The testssl.sh tool was downloaded using: git clone https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh.git

Execute permission was given to the script: nchmod +x testssl.sh

The SSL/TLS scan was performed using: ./testssl.sh nasa.gov


* The tool will display vulnerabilitie if any weak or insecure SSL/TLS algorithms are present.

CVSS v3.x: 5.3 – 7.4
Severity: Medium
Priority: P3



                                                                                                Impact


If weak or insecure SSL/TLS algorithms are enabled, an attacker may:

Intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic
Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
Exploit protocol downgrade weaknesses
Access sensitive user or application data



                                                                                                Remediation


Disable deprecated protocols: SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1
Enforce TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3
Remove weak cipher suites: RC4, DES, 3DES, MD5
Use strong encryption: AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305
Ensure certificates use SHA-256 or stronger
Regularly audit SSL/TLS settings using security tools
