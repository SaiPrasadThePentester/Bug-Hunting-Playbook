The application enforces password complexity requirements only on the client side.
Although the registration page displays a strong password policy, these checks can be bypassed by intercepting and modifying the HTTP request.
The backend fails to validate password strength, allowing accounts to be created with weak passwords that do not meet the stated policy.




                                                                                          Steps to Reproduce





1.Navigate to the account registration page.

2.Fill in all required fields with valid details (email, username, etc.).

3.Observe the password requirement hint, for example:
Password must be at least 8 characters, include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special symbol.

4.Enter a strong password (e.g., Secure@123) to pass frontend validation.

5.Intercept the registration request using Burp Suite or Fiddler.

6Modify the request body and change the password value to a weak password, such as: 123456

7.Forward the modified request to the server.

8.bserve that the server responds with success.

9.Log in using the weak password.

➡️ This confirms a password policy bypass.




❌ Actual Behavior:
Server accepts weak passwords.
Password policy is enforced only in the browser.


✅ Expected Behavior:
Server should validate password strength.
Requests violating password policy should be rejected.

An attacker can: Create accounts with weak or guessable passwords
                 Reduce overall account security
                 Increase effectiveness of brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks (if rate limiting is absent)
                 Undermine stated security controls and user trust


               
                 
                                                                                            Remediation



Enforce password policy validation on the server side
Reject passwords that do not meet complexity requirements

Apply consistent validation on: Client side (UX)
                               Server side (security)

Log rejected password policy violations

Combine with: Rate limiting
              MFA for sensitive accounts
