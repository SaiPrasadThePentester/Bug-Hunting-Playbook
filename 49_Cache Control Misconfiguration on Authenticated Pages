The application does not properly implement cache-control headers on authenticated pages.
As a result, sensitive content remains stored in the browser cache and can be accessed using the browser’s Back button even after the user has logged out.
This behavior may expose sensitive user information, especially on shared or public systems.



                                                                                    Steps to Reproduce



1.Log in to the website using valid credentials.

2.After successful login, navigate to any authenticated page (Dashboard, Profile, Account page).

3.Click the Logout option to log out of the application.

4.After logout, click the browser Back button (←).

5.Observe that the browser displays the previous authenticated page content.

An attacker or unauthorized user can: View sensitive user information after logout
                                      Access cached pages on shared systems
                                      Perform shoulder-surfing attacks
                                     Violate user privacy expectations
                                     Increase risk of data exposure



                                                                                            
                                                                                                Remediation





Implement proper cache-control headers on all authenticated pages: Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private
                                                                   Pragma: no-cache
                                                                   Expires: 0


Ensure logout functionality: Invalidates the session server-side

Force revalidation of session on page load

Prevent caching of sensitive pages at: Browser level
                                       Proxy level
Test behavior across multiple browsers
