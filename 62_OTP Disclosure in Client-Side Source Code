The application exposes the One-Time Password (OTP) directly in the client-side source code.
Due to insecure implementation, the OTP is hardcoded or rendered in hidden HTML fields, JavaScript variables, or comments, allowing attackers to view and use it without accessing the victim’s email or phone.
This completely breaks the OTP security mechanism and allows authentication bypass


                                                    
                                                                                Steps to Reproduce



1.Navigate to the OTP verification page.

2.Right-click on the page and select “View Page Source” (or press Ctrl + U).

3.Inspect the HTML and JavaScript code.

4.Look for OTP values exposed in: Hidden input fields
                                  JavaScript variables
                                  Comments

Example insecure code: <input type="hidden" name="otp" value="938275">  [OR]  var otp = "938275";


5.Copy the exposed OTP value.

6.Enter the OTP into the verification field.

7.Observe that OTP verification succeeds without checking email or SMS.

➡️ This confirms OTP bypass via client-side exposure.

An attacker can: View OTP directly from source code
                Bypass phone/email verification
                Authenticate as another user
                Perform account takeover
                completely defeat multi-factor authentication
                Abuse login, registration, or password reset flows



                                                                                Remediation



Never expose OTPs in client-side code
Generate OTPs only on the server
Store OTPs securely (hashed, time-limited)
Validate OTPs strictly server-side
Remove hidden fields or JS variables containing sensitive data
Expire OTPs after one use
Implement rate limiting on OTP verification attempts
