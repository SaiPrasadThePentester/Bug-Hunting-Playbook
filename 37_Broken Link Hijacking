Broken Link Hijacking (BLH) is a security vulnerability where attackers take control of abandoned or broken external links referenced by a website and misuse them to serve malicious content, phishing pages, or SEO spam.
This occurs when a website links to an external resource (such as a JavaScript file, image, CDN asset, or social media profile) that is no longer active because.



                                                                  Broken Link Hijacking (Social Media Takeover)



Scenario:
         A company previously maintained official social media profiles such as Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn and linked them on its website.


Later, the company:
                   Deletes the social media account, or
                   Changes the username, or
                   Stops using the platform

However, the website link is not updated or removed.


  
How the Attack Happens :

1️⃣ The website still contains a link like: https://twitter.com/companyname


2️⃣ The original social media account is deleted or abandoned

3️⃣ An attacker notices the broken link

4️⃣ The attacker creates a new account using the same username

5️⃣ The website now unknowingly links to the attacker-controlled profile
