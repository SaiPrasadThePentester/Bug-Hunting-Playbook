The application allows users to register and use an account without verifying their email address or phone number.
No verification email or SMS OTP is sent after registration, and the user can continue accessing the application without confirming ownership of the provided contact details.
This allows attackers to create accounts using fake, third-party, or impersonated email addresses and phone numbers.
