No SPF Record is an email security misconfiguration where a domain does not have a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record configured in DNS, allowing any mail server to send emails on behalf of that domain.
Because there is no SPF policy to verify authorized senders, attackers can spoof the domain and send phishing or fraudulent emails that appear legitimate.


                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       Steps to Reproduce – No SPF Record



1.Check SPF Record Using Online Tools  :Kitterman.org/spf/validate.html
                                      https://mxtoolbox.com/SPF.aspx
                                      https://dnschecker.org/spf-record.php

2.Confirm the Vulnerability
If the result shows: No SPF record found


3.Extract Email Addresses from the Target Website
  Scrape or manually find emails from contact pages, About Us, privacy policies, or blog posts.


 4.A spoofed email was sent by impersonating a company-related email address and delivering it to a victim using an online email spoofing service (emkei.cz).
  
5.Provide sender address was company related any  email, the recipient address was the victim’s email,send it






                                                                                     CVSS Score

CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.5 – Medium | P3




                                                                                      Impact

If SPF is not configured, an attacker can:
Spoof emails using the company’s domain
Impersonate employees or support teams
Perform phishing and social-engineering attacks
Trick users into sharing credentials or sensitive data
Damage brand reputation and trust
Reduce email deliverability (emails marked as spam)



                                                                                   Remediation



Add an SPF record to the domain’s DNS
Specify only authorized mail servers

Use a strict policy for production
Example SPF Record :v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all

Implement DKIM (email signing)
Implement DMARC (policy enforcement)
Regularly audit DNS email records
Monitor spoofing attempts using DMARC reports
