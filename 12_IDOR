IDOR is a vulnerability where an application exposes internal object references (like user IDs, file IDs, order numbers) and fails to properly check authorization, allowing attackers to access or modify other users’ data.

                          
                                                                                            Easy Example

GET /profile?id=1001   ← your account
GET /profile?id=1002   ← another user

Parameter To Test:Id,gid,pip,uid,uuid,user,username,file,file name,dest


                                                                                    
                                                                                     IDOR testing guide using Burp Suite

Account Editing Time (Profile Update):
🔍 Intercepted Request:
POST /api/user/update
{
  "user_id": "1001",
  "email": "test@mail.com"
}

🧪 Test:
Change user_id=1001 → 1002
Send request via Repeater

🚨Vulnerable If :Profile of another user gets updated.

                                                                                               Impact

If IDOR exists, an attacker can:
👤 Access other users’ profiles & personal data
📦 View order history and invoices
🔑 Change passwords of other users
🛒 Add/remove products from another user’s cart
❌ Cancel or manipulate orders
💬 Read private messages or chat history
💸 Cause financial loss and data privacy violations



                                                                                             Remediation
✅ 1. Enforce Server-Side Authorization
Always validate:Does this user own this object?
               never rely on client-side checks


✅ 2. Use Indirect Object References

Avoid exposing real IDs:
❌ /invoice?id=1023
✅ /invoice?id=8f3d9c_token


✅ 3. Access Control Checks on Every Request

Apply authorization for:
Profile edit
Order history
Password change
Invoice access
Cart actions
Chat/messages


✅ 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Ensure: Users → only their own data
        Admins → admin-only objects


✅ 5. Logging & Monitoring
Log unauthorized access attempts
Alert on ID manipulation patterns
