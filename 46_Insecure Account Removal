The application allows a logged-in user to delete their account without re-authentication or password confirmation.
The account deletion process does not require the user to verify their identity by re-entering the account password or completing any additional security check.
This behavior increases the risk of account deletion by attackers who gain access to an active session through session hijacking, XSS, shared devices, or unattended logins.

An attacker can: Permanently delete a victim’s account
                 Cause irreversible data loss
                 Exploit hijacked or unattended sessions
                 Abuse shared or public devices
                Disrupt user access and trust

Require password confirmation before account deletion
Enforce MFA verification for destructive actions
Implement re-authentication for sensitive operations
Add a cool-down or grace period before permanent deletion
Notify users via email when account deletion is requested
