The application allows users to create multiple accounts using Gmail email aliases (the +alias feature).
Although all alias emails are delivered to the same Gmail inbox, the application treats each alias as a unique email address, allowing unlimited account creation.

This can be abused to: Bypass account-creation limits
                       Create fake or duplicate accounts
                        Abuse referral, voting, or free-trial systems

1.Register a new account using: saijain8520@gmail.com
2.Log out of the application.
3.Register again using: saijain8520+1@gmail.com
4.Repeat registration using additional aliases: saijain8520+2@gmail.com, saijain8520+3@gmail.com...
5.Check the Gmail inbox: All confirmation emails are received in the same inbox
                      Activate each account using the received links.
6.Log in successfully with all created accounts.

➡️ Multiple valid accounts are created using one email inbox.

An attacker can: Create unlimited fake accounts
                 Abuse referral or reward systems
                  Bypass free-trial restrictions
                  Inflate user counts
                  Perform spam or automation attacks
                  Reduce platform trust


                                                                                            Remediation


Normalize Gmail addresses by: Removing +alias portion
                              Enforce one account per normalized email
                              Add rate-limiting on registrations
                               Use additional verification for sensitive actions
                                Monitor for alias-based abuse patterns
