Sensitive data exposure through GitHub dorking occurs when developers accidentally push confidential information (such as API keys, credentials, tokens, or database URLs) into public GitHub repositories,Attackers use advanced GitHub search queries (dorks) to systematically discover this exposed information.


                                                                                    Steps to Reproduce


1.Open the GitHub website and log in 

2.Use the GitHub Search Bar

3.In the search bar, enter a targeted dork combining the organization/domain name with a sensitive keyword.
 Example Search Query: nasa.com "DB_PASSWORD"

If sensitive data is exposed through public GitHub repositories, an attacker can:
Gain unauthorized access to applications or APIs
Perform account takeover
Access or dump databases
Abuse paid third-party services (billing impact)
Move laterally into internal infrastructure
Chain with other vulnerabilities
Cause financial loss and reputation damage


                                                                                  Remediation


Revoke and rotate all exposed credentials immediately
Remove sensitive data from public repositories
Make affected repositories private (if required)
