The application allows an already authenticated session to remain active even after Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) is enabled on the account from another device.
After enabling MFA on one device, previously logged-in sessions on other devices are not invalidated or re-verified, allowing sensitive actions such as page access or password changes without completing MFA verification.
This behavior weakens the security guarantees of MFA and may allow attackers with an existing session to continue accessing the account even after MFA is enabled.




                                                                                    Steps to Reproduce





1.Identify an Website with MFA / 2FA Support
2.Create an Account
3.Log in to the application using valid credentials.
4.Log In on a Second Device or Browser
5.Enable MFA on the First Device

6.On Device 2 (existing session):
Reload the page, or Perform any authenticated action such as: Accessing account pages
                                                              Changing the password
                                                               Updating profile information



Observe the Behavior :
If the action succeeds without requiring MFA re-authentication,
➜ the application is vulnerable.

If MFA does not invalidate existing sessions, an attacker who already has access can:
Bypass MFA protection entirely
Continue using a compromised session even after MFA is enabled
Change account password or email
Access sensitive user data
Maintain persistence on the account
Defeat the primary purpose of MFA
Increase risk of account takeover



                                                                                       Remediation



Invalidate all active sessions immediately when MFA/2FA is enabled
Force re-authentication with MFA on all other devices
Require MFA for high-risk actions (password, email, security settings)
Rotate session tokens after MFA enablement
Implement centralized session management
Display a list of active sessions and allow users to revoke them
Log and alert on MFA status changes
