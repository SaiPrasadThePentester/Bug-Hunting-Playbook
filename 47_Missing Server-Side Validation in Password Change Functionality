The application enforces password change restrictions only on the client side.
Although the UI prevents users from setting the new password identical to the current password, this validation can be bypassed by modifying the request using an interception proxy.
The backend fails to revalidate the password rules, allowing password changes that violate security policies.


                                                                                     
                                                                                        Steps to Reproduce 1 


1.Log in to the application using valid credentials.

2.Navigate to Dashboard → Change Password.

3.Enter: Current Password: <current_password>
        New Password: <current_password>
          Confirm Password: <current_password>

4.Click Submit.

5...Observe a client-side :If Password updated Vulnerable


                                                                         
                                                                                          Steps to Reproduce 2




1.Log in to the application using valid credentials.

2.Navigate to Dashboard → Change Password.

3.Enter: Current Password: <current_password>
       New Password: <current_password>
        Confirm Password: <current_password>

4.Click Submit.

5.Observe a client-side error: “Old and new passwords should not be the same.”

5.Enable Burp Suite and turn Intercept ON.

6.Return to the Change Password form:

7.Enter the correct current password.

8.Enter a different new password to pass client-side validation.

9.When the request is intercepted: Modify new password and confirm password to be the same as the current password.

10.Forward the modified request to the server.

11.Observe the response: Server returns 200 OK
                      Password is updated successfully.


➡️ This confirms missing server-side validation.

An attacker can: Bypass enforced password policies
                  Keep using weak or reused passwords
                  Reduce the effectiveness of password rotation
                   Increase risk of account compromise
                  Undermine overall authentication security


                  
                  
                                                                                            Remediation





Enforce all password rules server-side
Reject password changes where: New password equals old password

Apply consistent validation on: Client side (UX)
                                Server side (security)

Implement centralized password policy validation
Log and monitor failed password change attempts

Combine with: Strong password complexity rules
              MFA for sensitive actions
