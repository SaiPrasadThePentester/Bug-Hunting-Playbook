Example : https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/



Vulnerable If: Bucket contents are listed
               Files open or download without authentication

➡️ Indicates public read access




                                                                                       Tool


#sudo apt install awscli
aws s3 ls s3://bucketname --no-sign-request { List Files in a Public S3 Bucket } 
aws s3 cp s3://bucketname/filename /home/saijain --no-sign-request { Download File from Public S3 Bucket }



                                                                                      CVSS Score

▶ Public Read Access : CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5 – High
Public Write / Delete Access : CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.1 – Critical





                                                                                           Impact

                                                                                       Remediation


Enable S3 Block Public Access
Remove public ACLs and bucket policies
Revoke exposed object permissions
Rotate exposed credentials (if any)
