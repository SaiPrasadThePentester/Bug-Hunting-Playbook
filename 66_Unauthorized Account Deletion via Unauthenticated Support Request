The application’s support process (support form or live chat) allows users to request account deletion without any authentication or identity verification.
If the support team deletes an account solely based on information submitted through a form or chat, an attacker can impersonate another user and request deletion of their account, leading to unauthorized and irreversible actions.



                                                                                     Steps to Reproduce

1.Navigate to the company’s support contact form or live chat feature.

2.Submit a request with the following details:

3.Target user’s email address

4.Request message asking for account deletion

5.Do not authenticate as the target user.

6.Do not provide proof of identity.

Observe the support workflow: If the support team processes the request and deletes the account,
➜ the vulnerability exists.
