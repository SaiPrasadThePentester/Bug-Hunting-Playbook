No Rate Limiting is a security vulnerability where an application does not restrict the number of requests a user or attacker can send to sensitive endpoints within a given time period,As a result, attackers can repeatedly trigger actions such as OTP delivery, password reset emails, or subscription emails without any restriction


                                                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                 Steps to Reproduce




1️⃣ Capture the OTP / Password Reset Request

1.Open the target application.
2.Trigger an action such as: Login with OTP
                           Password reset request
                           Email/phone verification
3.Intercept the request using Burp Suite Proxy.




2️⃣Intruder → Positions Tab

1.Go to the Positions tab.
2.Click Clear to remove all default payload markers.
3.Manually highlight any parameter that allows repeated requests, such as: Body parameter
                                                                          Content-Length
                                                                             Expires
                                                                           Accept-Language (e.g., change en-US;q=0.5)






3️⃣Intruder → Payloads Tab

1.Set Payload Type: Numbers
2.Configure: From: 1
            To: 500
3.➡️ This simulates 500 repeated OTP / reset requests.


4️⃣Click Start Attack
Monitor the responses: HTTP Status Code remains 200 OK
Response content length remains the same (e.g., “OTP sent”)
No error or blocking message
No increasing delay between responses


                 
                                                                            Signs of No Rate Limiting (Vulnerable)


OTP is sent every time without restriction
No CAPTCHA after multiple attempts
No temporary block or cooldown
Same response message for all requests
No IP-based or account-based lockout




                                                                                        CVSS Score



▶ OTP / Password Reset / Verification Abuse
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.5 – Medium



▶ API-Level Abuse / Business Logic Impact
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5 – High



                                                                                          Impact



If rate limiting is not enforced, an attacker can:
Spam users with:
SMS OTPs
Email OTPs
WhatsApp verification messages
Flood inboxes with password reset emails
Abuse resend OTP functionality
Trigger repeated verification messages
Spam invitation or referral links
Exhaust SMS / email quotas (financial loss)
Enable OTP brute-force attacks
Cause service degradation or DoS
Damage brand reputation and user trust



                                                                                     Remediation




1.Implement rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints

2.Limit requests by: IP address
                   User account
               Email / phone number

3.Enforce cooldown timers for OTP resend
