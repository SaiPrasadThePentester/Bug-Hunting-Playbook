                                                                                  Clickjacking – Automatic Testing Tool

Clickjacker.io is an online automatic tool used to check whether a website is vulnerable to Clickjacking.

How to Use :
Open https://clickjacker.io/
Enter the target website URL
Run the test

Review the result:
Vulnerable → Site loads inside iframe
Not Vulnerable → Framing is blocked


                                                                                Clickjacking – Manual Testing Using HTML File

1.Create an HTML file (e.g., clickjack.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Clickjacking Test</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>The site may be vulnerable to clickjacking:</p>
  <iframe src="https://oec.gov.pk" height="700" width="700"></iframe>
</body>
</html>


2.Open the HTML file in a browser

3.If the target website loads inside the iframe, it means the website does not block framing,This confirms the website is vulnerable to Clickjacking
