Subdomain takeover occurs when a subdomain points to an external third-party service (such as cloud hosting or SaaS platforms), but that service is no longer active or properly configured,Even though the DNS record still exists, the actual resource it points to has been deleted or released. This allows an attacker to claim the abandoned resource and take control of the subdomain.




                                                                               Steps To Reproduce


1️⃣ Check if Subdomain Points to a Third-Party Service (CNAME)
Using dig: dig subdomain.example.com CNAME

Vulnerable Sign:
Output shows a third-party service domain, for example: subdomain.example.com.  CNAME  example.azurewebsites.net.



2️⃣ Verify Using nslookup 
#nslookup subdomain.example.com

Look for Service-specific domains like: github.io
                                       azurewebsites.net
                                        amazonaws.com
                                      herokuapp.com
                                      cloudfront.net


➡️ This confirms the subdomain depends on an external service.



                                                               
                                                                                          Confirm Takeover Possibility

                                                      
Check the service name against the takeover reference list: https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz

If a subdomain takeover is exploited, an attacker can:
Fully control a trusted subdomain
Host phishing pages under a legitimate domain
Steal user credentials and session data
Serve malware or malicious downloads
Bypass user trust due to:
Valid HTTPS
Organization-owned domain
Damage brand reputation
Chain attacks (OAuth abuse, cookie theft, XSS hosting)


                                                                                              Remediation



Remove the dangling DNS record (CNAME / A record)
Reclaim the resource on the third-party service immediately
