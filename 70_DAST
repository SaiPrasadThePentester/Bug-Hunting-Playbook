                                                            ✅ DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) – Line by Line

1. Tests the app/website while it's running live
2. Used after deployment, on test or staging server
3. Does not need source code, only a live URL or app
4. Simulates real-world hacker behavior
5. Finds runtime vulnerabilities (actual exploits)
6. Slower than SAST, but more accurate
7. Best for testers and security analysts
8. Can’t point to exact line of code causing the issue
9. Also called black-box testing


                                                                       🔐 DAST can detect these attacks


✅ SQL Injection (by injecting into forms or URLs)
✅ XSS (by sending malicious scripts and watching output)
✅ Broken authentication (brute-force, bypass)
✅ Security misconfigurations (open ports, debug info)
✅ Command injection (executes commands on target)
✅ RCE (checks if arbitrary code can run)
✅ Sensitive data exposure (checks for HTTPS, cookie leaks)
✅ File upload flaws (tests if malware upload possible)
✅ Brute force attacks (tries multiple passwords)
✅ API security issues (tests actual API behavior)
