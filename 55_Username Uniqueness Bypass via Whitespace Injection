The application enforces username uniqueness checks without proper normalization.
While registering the username admin correctly returns an error stating that the username is already taken, the same restriction can be bypassed by adding leading and/or trailing whitespace characters.
As a result, usernames such as " admin", "admin ", or " admin " are accepted as new, distinct accounts.
This allows attackers to create admin-like or trusted-looking usernames, enabling impersonation and social-engineering attacks.



                                                                        
                                                                         
                                                                                Steps to Reproduce




1.Navigate to the user registration page.

2.Attempt to register with the username: admin

3.Observe the expected error: This username is already taken.

4.Now try registering with one of the following usernames:
" admin"
"admin "
" admin "

5.Submit the registration form.

6.Observe that the account is successfully created.

➡️ This confirms a username uniqueness bypass via whitespace manipulation.

An attacker can: Impersonate admin-like or trusted users
                  Mislead users via messages or posts
                 Send phishing or malicious links
                  Abuse social trust within the platform
                   Damage brand reputation
                    Enable social-engineering attacks

Normalize usernames before validation:
Trim leading/trailing whitespace
Convert to a canonical form
Enforce uniqueness checks on the normalized value
Block usernames that visually impersonate: admin,support,moderator
Apply validation server-side
Audit existing usernames and clean duplicates
Consider case-insensitive uniqueness enforcement
