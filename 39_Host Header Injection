Host Header Injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the Host header in an HTTP request to inject arbitrary or attacker-controlled values.


The Host header tells the web server which domain the client is requesting, and many applications trust this header to: Generate absolute URLs

                                                                                                                        Build password reset links
                                                                                                                        Route requests internally
                                                                                                                        
If the application does not properly validate or restrict the Host header, an attacker can exploit this trust.

1.Visit the Target Website
Open the target application in a browser.


2.Capture the Request Using Burp Suite
Configure the browser to use Burp Suite Proxy.
Navigate to any page of the application.
Intercept the HTTP request in Burp Suite.


3.Modify the Host Header ,Send It

1.X-Forwaded-Host:bing.com { add below host field }

2.HOST:bing.com
X-Forwaded-Host:original domain name { add below host field }

3.HOST:original domain name
Referer:bing.com { add below host field }

4.HOST:bing.com
Referer:bing.com


4.Confirm the Vulnerability
Search the response for the injected keyword (e.g., bing). If it appears, the application is vulnerable.

▶Basic Host Header Reflection / Trust Issue
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.1 – Medium

▶ Advanced Impact (Password Reset Poisoning / Cache Poisoning / SSRF)
 CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.2 – High



                                                                                         Impact


If Host Header Injection exists, an attacker can:
Perform open redirect attacks
Poison web caches
Manipulate password reset links
Conduct phishing attacks
Inject content leading to XSS
Trigger SSRF via backend services
Abuse trusted domains and damage reputation




                                                                                      Remediation




Do not trust the Host header directly
Enforce a strict allowlist of valid domains
Use server-side configuration for canonical hostnames
Reject or normalize unexpected Host values
Avoid using Host header to build: URLs
                                  Password reset links
Prefer hardcoded base URLs in application logic
Configure reverse proxies correctly (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
Log and monitor invalid Host header usage
