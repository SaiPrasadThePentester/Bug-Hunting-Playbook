•	Zone Transfer Misconfiguration occurs when a DNS server allows unauthorized zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR), enabling anyone to download the entire DNS zone file of a domain.


                                                                                        Testing


dig dishtv.in +short ns
dig axfr @servername dishtv.in


NOTE: If a DNS AXFR (zone transfer) request returns any domain data, it indicates a DNS zone transfer misconfiguration and is considered a vulnerability.

If DNS zone transfer is allowed to unauthorized users, attackers can:

1.Enumerate all subdomains

2.Identify: Internal systems
          Mail servers
         Dev / staging environments

3.Expand attack surface for: Web attacks
                        Network attacks
                        Phishing

4.Gain valuable reconnaissance data for further exploitation




                                                                                         Remediation



1.Disable AXFR for public/unauthorized clients
2.Restrict zone transfers to trusted secondary DNS servers only (by IP)
3.Enforce ACL rules on DNS servers
4.Use TSIG keys for authenticated zone transfers
5.Regularly audit DNS configuration

Example: Allow AXFR only between: Primary DNS → Secondary DNS
         Deny AXFR from: Internet,Unknown IPs
