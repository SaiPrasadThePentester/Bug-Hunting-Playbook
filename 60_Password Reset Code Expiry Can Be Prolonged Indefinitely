The application uses a time-based password reset verification code (6-digit OTP) that is intended to expire after 1 hour.
However, requesting another password reset before the original code expires causes the same verification code to be reissued and its expiration time to be extended by another full hour.
By repeatedly requesting password resets just before expiration, an attacker can keep the same reset code valid indefinitely, significantly increasing the feasibility of brute-force or guessing attacks.


                                                              
                                                                            Steps to Reproduce



1.Request a password reset for a valid account.
2.Receive a 6-digit verification code via email.
3.Note the initial expiry time (e.g., code issued at 6:00 AM, expires at 7:00 AM).
4.Before the code expires (e.g., 6:58 AM), request another password reset.

5.Observe that: The same verification code is sent again.
              The expiration time is extended (now valid until 7:58 AM).

6.Repeat the reset request shortly before the new expiry time.

7.Observe that the same code continues to remain valid with each request.

➡️ This confirms that the reset code’s lifetime can be prolonged indefinitely.

An attacker can: Keep password reset codes valid indefinitely
                 Gain extended time to brute-force or guess OTPs

Abuse password recovery flows
Increase likelihood of account takeover
Bypass intended security time restrictions
Combine with automation for large-scale attacks

Generate a new reset code for every password reset request
Invalidate all previous codes immediately
Enforce a maximum lifetime for reset codes
Prevent expiration extension of existing codes
Add rate limiting on password reset requests
Lock the reset process after multiple failed attempts
Log and monitor repeated reset requests
