CSP is a browser security mechanism that controls what content can be loaded and executed on a webpage.



Main Goal:
           Prevent: XSS,Data injection,Malicious scripts



Example CSP Header:
                   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'


➡️ Only scripts from the same domain are allowed.



What CSP controls:
                  JavaScript
                   CSS
                  Images
                  Fonts
                 Frames
                   APIs


Weak CSP Example:
                 script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'

❌ Allows inline JS → XSS risk
