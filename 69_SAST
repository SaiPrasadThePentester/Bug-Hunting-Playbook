1. Scans the source code without running the app/website
2. Used early in development, before deployment
3. Detects code-level vulnerabilities
4. Helps developers find and fix issues during coding
5. Runs faster, easy to integrate into CI/CD
6. May show false positives (not always exploitable)
7. Needs access to code files or binaries
8. Cannot find runtime misconfigurations
9. Also called white-box testing


                                                                                 🔐 SAST can detect these attacks

✅ SQL Injection (unsafe queries in code)
✅ XSS (unescaped user input in HTML)
✅ Hardcoded passwords (found in strings)
✅ Insecure API usage (missing auth checks in code)
✅ Command injection (use of unsafe exec() in code)
✅ CSRF (missing anti-CSRF tokens in forms)
✅ Sensitive data exposure (storing passwords without hashing)
