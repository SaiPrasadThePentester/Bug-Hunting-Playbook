1.Enter a valid OTP and observe the server response. Pay attention to the response structure, status code, and any success message returned by the server.
2.Next, enter an invalid OTP during the verification process and intercept the request using Burp Suite.
3.When the server response is intercepted, modify the ending part of the response so that it looks similar to the response received for a valid OTP (for example, changing the status message or success indicator).
4.Forward the modified response to the browser.
