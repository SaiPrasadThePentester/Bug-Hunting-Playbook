The application discloses a user’s email address when a previously used email confirmation link is accessed again.
After successful account verification, reusing the same confirmation URL reveals the email address associated with the token.
This behavior allows attackers to confirm the existence of an email address and associate it with an account, leading to information disclosure and user enumeration.

1.Register a new account on the target website using your own email address, for example: test@example.com

2.Check your email inbox and locate the confirmation email.

3.Copy the confirmation link, which looks similar to: https://example.com/confirm?token=abc123

4.Click the confirmation link to activate the account successfully.

5.After the account is activated, copy and paste the same confirmation URL again into: A new browser tab, or A different browser, or Share it with another user

6.Observe the response shown on the webpage.



❌ Actual Behavior:
The page displays a message such as: “The email address test@example.com has already been confirmed.”
The email address is clearly disclosed to anyone accessing the link.


✅ Expected Behavior:
Used or expired confirmation links should: Display a generic message (e.g., “This link is no longer valid”)
                                           Not reveal any email address or user information
                                           
                                           
                                           
                                           
                                       
                                       
                                                                                     CVSS Score

An attacker can: Confirm whether an email address is registered
                 Enumerate users via reused confirmation links
                Collect valid email addresses
                Assist phishing or social-engineering attacks
                Reduce user privacy


                
                                                                                     Remediation



Do not display email addresses in confirmation responses
Use generic messages for used or expired links
Invalidate confirmation tokens immediately after use

Bind confirmation tokens strictly to: One user
                                      One use

Log and monitor repeated access to confirmation URLs
