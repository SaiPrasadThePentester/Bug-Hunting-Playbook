The application does not properly remove or restrict access to user-uploaded files after an account is deleted.
Even after a user deletes their account, previously uploaded profile images remain publicly accessible via their direct URLs.
This results in orphaned resources that continue to be accessible without authentication, leading to privacy issues and potential data exposure.


                                                                                  Steps to Reproduce

Log in to the application with a valid user account.
Navigate to the Profile section.
Upload a profile picture.
Copy the direct URL of the uploaded image.
Delete the user account.
Open the copied image URL in a browser (logged out or incognito).
Observe that the image is still accessible.

➡️ Vulnerability confirmed: file remains accessible after account deletion.
