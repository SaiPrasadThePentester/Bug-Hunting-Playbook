A01: Broken Access Control
Occurs when users can access data or perform actions beyond their permissions.
Example: Normal user accessing admin APIs, IDOR, privilege escalation.

A02: Cryptographic Failures
Sensitive data is exposed due to weak or missing encryption.
Example: Plaintext passwords, weak hashing (MD5), no HTTPS, exposed secrets.

A03: Injection
Untrusted input is sent to an interpreter and executed as commands or queries.
Example: SQL Injection, OS Command Injection, NoSQL Injection.

A04: Insecure Design
Flaws in application architecture or business logic from the design stage.
Example: No rate-limiting, insecure workflows, missing abuse cases.

A05: Security Misconfiguration
Incorrect or insecure configuration of servers, apps, or services.
Example: Default credentials, open admin panels, verbose error messages.

A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Using libraries or software with known vulnerabilities.
Example: Old frameworks, vulnerable plugins, outdated server software.

A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
Weak authentication mechanisms allowing account compromise.
Example: Brute-force attacks, weak passwords, session fixation.

A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
Lack of integrity checks on software updates, CI/CD, or deserialization.
Example: Insecure deserialization, malicious updates, supply-chain attacks.

A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Insufficient logging and alerting of security events.
Example: Attacks not logged, no alerts for failed logins or exploitation.

A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Server makes unintended requests to internal or external systems.
Example: Accessing internal services, cloud metadata via user-controlled URLs.
