The application allows account creation using invalid email addresses that contain special characters and line termination characters such as %, %0d, and %0a.
These characters should not be accepted as part of a valid email address, but the system incorrectly processes them and successfully creates user accounts.
Although the email address is technically invalid and cannot be verified or receive emails, the account is still created and stored in the application’s database.


 
                                                                               
                                                                                  Steps to Reproduce



1.Navigate to the signup / registration page of the website.

2.Enter valid values for: Username 
                        Password
                      Other required fields

3.In the Email Address field, enter an invalid email containing special or line-termination characters, for example: saijain8520%0d%0a@gmail.com or saijain8520%hackerone.com

4.Submit the registration form.

5.Observe that the account is successfully created despite the invalid email format.




Actual Behavior : Invalid email addresses are accepted.
                   Account is created and stored in the database.
                    Email verification cannot be completed.
                     Email notifications are never delivered.


✅ Expected Behavior : The application should reject invalid email formats.
                       Email input should be strictly validated according to RFC standards.
                       Account creation should be blocked until a valid email address is provided.

An attacker can: Create accounts with non-functional or malformed emails
                  Pollute the user database with invalid entries
                   Prevent legitimate email verification
                   Bypass email-based controls


Abuse the platform for: Spam
                       Fake account creation
                          Resource exhaustion

Potentially exploit email header injection if improperly handled elsewhere

Implement strict server-side email validation
Reject emails containing: %, %0d ,%0a etc..
Validate email format using: RFC-compliant regex
Normalize and sanitize email input
Enforce email verification before activating accounts
Remove or deactivate accounts with invalid emails
