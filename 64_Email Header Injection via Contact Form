The application is vulnerable to Email Header Injection due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the contact form.
By injecting newline characters (%0A, %0D) into the email field, an attacker can manipulate email headers and add additional recipients (such as Cc or Bcc).
This allows attackers to receive copies of emails sent by the application, potentially leading to information disclosure and spam abuse.


                                                                           
                                                                            Steps to Reproduce


1. Go to the Contact Form
Visit the contact form page of the target website.

Fill in the fields normally:
Name: Test
Email: test@gmail.com
Phone: 1234567890
Message: Hello


2. Intercept the Request
Open Burp Suite
Turn Intercept ON
Submit the contact form
The HTTP request will be intercepted


3. Modify the Email Field
Inject a newline payload into the email parameter: test@gmail.com%0ACc:attacker@gmail.com
Example modified request body: name=Test&email=test@gmail.com%0ACc:attacker@gmail.com&message


4. Forward the Request
Click Forward in Burp Suite to send the modified request to the server.

5. Observe the Result
The contact form email is sent successfully.
The attacker-controlled email address in the Cc field also receives the email.

➡️ This confirms Email Header Injection.

An attacker can: Receive copies of internal emails
                Collect sensitive contact form submissions
                 Abuse the application for spam
                Perform phishing or social engineering
                 Damage the reputation of the mail server
                    Potentially escalate to more advanced email attacks




                                                                                 Remediation


Sanitize email input to block: %0A, %0D, \r , \n
Validate email addresses using strict server-side validation
Never directly concatenate user input into email headers
Use secure email libraries that prevent header injection
Log and monitor suspicious email payloads
