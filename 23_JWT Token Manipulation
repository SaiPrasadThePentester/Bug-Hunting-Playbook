A JWT (JSON Web Token) vulnerability was identified where the application failed to properly validate the JWT signature or used a weak signing algorithm, allowing token tampering and unauthorized access.


                                                                                              
                                                                                          Testing Methodology



1.A login request containing username and password was intercepted using an interception proxy.
2.After forwarding the request, the server responded with a JWT token in the:
3.Authorization header / Cookie / Response body.
4.The JWT token was copied and decoded using an online JWT decoder (e.g., jwt.io, jwt.one).
5.The decoded token revealed sensitive claims, including: user_id , email, role
6.The application did not properly validate the JWT signature or relied on a weak signing algorithm.
7.The email or user_id value inside the token was modified.
8.A new token was generated and replaced in the request header.
9.The modified request was forwarded to the server.
10The server accepted the tampered JWT and granted access to another user’s account.

CVSS v3.x: 8.8 – 9.8
Severity: High to Critical
Priority: P1



                                                                                            Impact

If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker can:

Impersonate other users
Access sensitive user data
Escalate privileges (user → admin)
Bypass authentication and authorization controls
Take full control of accounts



                                                                                          Remediation


Enforce strong JWT signature verification on the server
Use secure signing algorithms (e.g., RS256, HS256 with strong secret)
Never accept alg: none
Do not store sensitive data directly inside JWT claims
Validate token integrity, expiration, and issuer on every request
Rotate signing keys regularly
Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) on the server side
