CORS is a controlled relaxation of SOP that allows cross-origin access explicitly.

How it works: Uses HTTP response headers sent by the server.

Important Headers
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods
Access-Control-Allow-Headers
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

Example: 
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted.com


➡️ Allows trusted.com to access the resource.
Common Misconfiguration
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

❌ High-risk misconfiguration



Security Impact: Data leakage
                Account takeover (in some cases)
