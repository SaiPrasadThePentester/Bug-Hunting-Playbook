The application’s user registration process allows users to create accounts using weak passwords that do not meet basic security complexity requirements. Passwords with short length and lacking a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters are accepted without any warning or rejection.
This significantly increases the risk of brute-force and dictionary attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized account access.

1.Navigate to the sign-up / account registration page on the website

2.Enter valid user details.

3.Set a weak password such as: 123456

4.Submit the registration form.

5.Observe that the weak password is accepted without any validation error or warning



                                                                                  
                                                                                    CVSS Score

Attackers can easily guess or brute-force passwords
Increased risk of account compromise
Weak passwords reduce the effectiveness of other security controls
May fail to comply with security standards such as: NIST SP 800-63B
                                                    OWASP ASVS
Can lead to credential stuffing attacks if reused passwords are used

1.Implement a strong password policy, including:

2.Minimum 8 characters length

3.At least: One uppercase letter
          One lowercase letter
          One number
         One special character

4.Block commonly used or breached passwords

5.Enforce validation on both client-side and server-side

Optionally: Use a password strength meter
            Encourage passphrases
