The application allows users to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on an account without first verifying the registered email address.
As a result, an attacker can create an account using someone else’s email address, enable 2FA, and lock the legitimate email owner out of the account.
This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition against the real email owner, rather than direct account takeover.

Visit a website that allows account registration.
Create a new account using an unverified email address (no email OTP or confirmation required).
Log in to the newly created account.
Navigate to Dashboard → Security Settings → 2FA.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication using an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
Log out.

An attacker can: Register using a victim’s email address
                Enable 2FA on the account
                Prevent the legitimate email owner from registering
                Cause a denial-of-service to the real email owner
                Lock the victim out even after password reset (2FA blocks login)



                                                                                                Remediation



Enforce email verification before enabling 2FA
Block access to 2FA settings for unverified accounts
Require re-authentication before enabling 2FA
Notify the email owner when:
2FA is enabled
Security settings are changed
Allow email owners to reclaim accounts if email is verified later
