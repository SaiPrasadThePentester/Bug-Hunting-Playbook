The application’s email verification mechanism does not correctly bind verification tokens to a specific email address.
By modifying parameters in the email verification request, a verification token issued for one account can be reused to verify a different email address.
This allows attackers to verify arbitrary email addresses without owning the inbox, leading to account impersonation and security bypass.

                                            
                                                                                 Steps to Reproduce



1.Navigate to the signup page and register an account using an email address that is not controlled by the tester (e.g., victim@example.com).

2.Do not verify the email for this account.

3.Register a second account using an email address controlled by the tester (e.g., attacker@example.com).

4.Open the verification email sent to the second account and intercept the verification request using an interception proxy.

5.Observe the verification request format, for example: /verify-email?token=<token>&email=attacker@example.com

6.Modify the email parameter in the intercepted request to: victim@example.com

7.Forward the modified request to the server.

8.Observe that the application marks the victim’s email address as verified, even though no verification email was accessed for that address.

➡️ This confirms an email verification bypass

An attacker can: Verify email addresses they do not own

Impersonate legitimate users
Bypass email-based security controls
Enable further attacks such as: Account takeover
                               Password reset abuse
                               Trust-based impersonation

Undermine the integrity of the account system

Bind verification tokens to: A specific user ID
                            A specific email address

Do not accept email values from client input
Store token-to-email mapping server-side

Invalidate tokens after: One use
                       Email change

Add integrity checks on verification requests
Log and alert on verification mismatches
