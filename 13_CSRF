CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a web security vulnerability that tricks an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on a web application without their consent.
The attacker abuses the victim’s active session to send unauthorized requests.



                                                                              Common CSRF Impact Scenarios

An attacker can force the victim to:
🔄 Change username
🔐 Change password
📧 Update email address
💸 Transfer funds
💳 Modify payment methods
⚙️ Change account settings



                                                                       Practical CSRF Exploitation (Using Burp Suite)

1.Login to the application using attacker account
2.Perform a state-changing action (e.g., password change)

3.Intercept the request using Burp Suite Proxy
Right-click the request → Engagement tools → Generate CSRF PoC

In options:
✅ Tick Include auto-submit script
Click Generate
Copy the generated HTML code


 4.Exploit Delivery

On attacker system:
Create a file named csrf.html using Notepad
Paste the copied HTML PoC
Share the file with the victim

5.When the victim opens csrf.html in the browser while logged in
👉 Boom! The action executes automatically

CVSS v3.x: 6.5 – 8.0
Severity: P1

Unauthorized account modifications

Loss of user trust
Compliance violations

                                                                               
                                                                                             Remediation

✅ 1. CSRF Tokens (Most Important)
Use unique, unpredictable CSRF tokens
Validate token on server side

✅ 2. SameSite Cookies
Set-Cookie: sessionid=xyz; SameSite=Strict

✅ 3. Re-authentication for Sensitive Actions

Ask password again for:Password change
                       Payment updates
                       Fund transfers

✅ 4. Validate HTTP Methods
Use POST/PUT/DELETE
Reject state changes via GET

✅ 5. Check Origin / Referer Headers
Validate trusted origins
