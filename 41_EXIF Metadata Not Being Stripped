EXIF Metadata Not Being Stripped is a security and privacy issue where an application allows users to upload images without removing embedded EXIF metadata.


EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata may contain sensitive information such as: GPS location (latitude & longitude)
                                                                                           Device make and model
                                                                                           Date and time the photo was taken
                                                                                           Camera serial numbers
                                                                                          Software used to edit the image
                                                                                          If this metadata is publicly accessible, it can lead to information disclosure and privacy risks.




                                                                                         
                                                                                  Steps to Reproduce 





1.Download any image from a public source (https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples/tree/master/jpg).


2.Log in to the target application.


3.Upload the image as a profile picture or in any image upload field.


4.After uploading, click on the profile picture (or uploaded image).


5.Copy the Image URL


6.Check EXIF Metadata
Open the copied image URL in an EXIF viewer tool.

7.Confirm the Vulnerability
If EXIF metadata such as: GPS location
                           Device model
                           Date/time
                           Camera information


     
     
                                                                                         CVSS Score




▶ General EXIF Information Exposure
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 4.3 – Low | P4


▶ If GPS / Precise Location Data Is Exposed
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 5.3 – Medium | P3




                                                                                         Impact


If EXIF metadata is not removed from uploaded images, an attacker can:
Extract GPS coordinates (exact location)
Identify where and when photos were taken
Reveal device make and model
Perform OSINT and user profiling
Track employees or users
Cause privacy and compliance issues



                                                                                        Remediation



Strip EXIF metadata server-side for all image uploads
Re-encode images after upload
Use secure image-processing libraries:
ImageMagick
Pillow (Python)
Sharp (Node.js)
Do not rely on client-side stripping
Verify uploaded images contain no metadata before storage or display
