A Race Condition occurs when an application processes multiple requests simultaneously without proper locking or validation,Attackers can exploit this timing gap to perform unauthorized actions that bypass business logic restrictions.


                                                                                              
                                                                                       Scenario

The application allows free users to create only 3 email (Gmail) accounts,Due to improper handling of concurrent requests, this limit can be bypassed by sending multiple requests at the same time


                                                                         
                                                                              Practical Exploitation (Using Burp Suite)



1.Log in to the application as a free user.
2.Attempt to create a new email account.
3.Intercept the account creation request using Burp Suite Proxy.
4.Send the intercepted request to Burp Repeater.
5.Copy the same request multiple times.
6.Modify the email ID in each copied request.


                                                                         
                                                                          Group Creation & Parallel Sending


1.Create a new tab group in Burp Repeater,Add all modified requests to the same group.
 Click Send → Send group in parallel
 (Single-packet / concurrent request attack)

📌 If the server processes all requests simultaneously without enforcing limits, more than 3 email accounts are created, confirming a race condition vulnerability.



                                                                                  
                                                                                    CVSS


CVSS v3.x: 7.0 – 8.6
Severity: High
Priority: P2




                                                                                    Impact


If exploited, an attacker can:
Bypass usage limits or quotas
Abuse free-tier restrictions
Create unlimited resources
Cause financial or service abuse
Break core business logic
Impact system integrity and fairness



                                                                                  Remediation


Implement server-side locking / synchronization
Use atomic operations for sensitive actions
Enforce limits at the database level
Apply rate limiting and request throttling
Validate state before and after processing requests
Use unique constraints and transactional controls
