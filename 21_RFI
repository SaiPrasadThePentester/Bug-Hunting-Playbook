RFI (Remote File Inclusion) is a web vulnerability where an attacker can include and execute a remote file (from an external server) on the vulnerable application,This happens when user input is used in file include functions without proper validation.

If an RFI vulnerability exists, an attacker can:
🐚 Execute remote malicious code on the server
🔐 Gain full server compromise
📂 Read/modify/delete application files
🦠 Install malware or backdoors
🗄️ Steal database credentials and sensitive data
🔁 Pivot to internal systems

❌ Never include files directly from user input
✅ Use allowlist-based file inclusion
🔍 Strictly validate and sanitize parameters
🚫 Disable dangerous settings: allow_url_include = Off
                                allow_url_fopen = Off
📁 Store include files outside web root
🛡️ Apply least-privilege file permissions
🔄 Keep server and application up to date
