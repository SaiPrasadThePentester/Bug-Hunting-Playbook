LFI (Local File Inclusion) is a web vulnerability where an attacker can read or include files from the server’s local filesystem due to improper input validation in file/path parameters.

If an LFI vulnerability exists, an attacker can:
📄 Read sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd)
🔐 Access configuration files (DB credentials, API keys)
🗄️ Leak application source code
📜 Read server logs
🔁 Chain LFI with log poisoning to achieve remote code execution



                                                                                          Remediation

✅ Use allowlist-based file inclusion
❌ Never include files directly from user input
🔍 Validate and sanitize file paths
🚫 Block directory traversal (../)
📁 Store sensitive files outside web root
⚙️ Disable dangerous PHP settings: allow_url_include = Off
                                    allow_url_fopen = Off
🛡️ Use proper file permissions
🧪 Regularly test file-handling parameters
