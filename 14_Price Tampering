Price Tampering is a web application vulnerability where an attacker manipulates price, quantity, or total amount parameters during a purchase flow,This occurs due to missing or weak server-side validation, allowing attackers to buy products or services at a lower price or for free.


                                                                 
                                                                         Practical Exploitation Using Burp Suite


1️⃣ Intercept the Purchase Request
Open Burp Suite
Proxy → Intercept ON
Add a product to the cart
Proceed to checkout
Capture the HTTP request

2️⃣ Modify the Price Parameter
🔍 Original Request:
POST /checkout HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "product_id": "123",
  "price": "100",
  "quantity": "1"
}


🧪 Modified Request:
{
  "product_id": "123",
  "price": "1",
  "quantity": "1"
}

3️⃣ Forward the Request
Click Forward
Send the modified request to the server

4️⃣ Check the Response
If the order is processed at ₹1 instead of ₹100

If exploited, an attacker can:
🛒 Purchase products at arbitrary prices
💸 Cause direct financial loss
🎟️ Obtain premium services for free
🔁 Automate mass fraudulent purchases
🧾 Break business logic and accounting
⚠️ Damage brand trust and compliance



                                                                                           Remediation


✅ 1. Server-Side Price Validation (Most Important)
Never trust client-side values
Fetch price only from database
Recalculate total on server

✅ 2. Use Product IDs, Not Prices
❌ Client sends price
✅ Client sends product_id → server fetches price

✅ 3. Protect APIs
Validate: price,quantity,discounts,coupons
Reject negative or decimal manipulation

✅ 4. Use Signed / Encrypted Tokens
HMAC or JWT-based order tokens
Prevent tampering of critical fields

✅ 5. Logging & Monitoring
Detect:Price mismatch attempts
       Repeated abnormal values
       Alert on fraud patterns
