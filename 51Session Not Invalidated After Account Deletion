The application does not properly invalidate active user sessions after an account is deleted or deactivated.
As a result, previously authenticated sessions remain valid and allow continued access to the application even though the account no longer exists.
This allows attackers with an existing session to maintain unauthorized access after account deletion.



                                                                                    Steps to Reproduce




1.Open Browser A (e.g., Chrome)
Navigate to the target application.
Log in using valid user credentials.


2.Open Browser B (e.g., Firefox / Incognito)
Navigate to the same application.
Log in using the same account credentials.
Confirm both sessions are active and working.


3.In Browser A
Go to Account Settings.
Select Deactivate Account or Delete Account.
Confirm the account deletion.


4.Return to Browser B
Attempt any authenticated actions:
Visit dashboard or profile
Access sensitive data (messages, settings, orders)
Perform API requests or submit forms


5.Observe the Behavior
The session in Browser B remains active and continues to function.

An attacker can: Continue using an active session even after the account is deleted
                 Access sensitive user information
                   Perform unauthorized actions
                    Maintain persistence using stolen or hijacked sessions
                     Bypass account lifecycle security controls
                    Cause privacy, compliance, and business impact



                                                                                                  Remediation



Invalidate all active sessions immediately after account deletion or deactivation
Revoke all session tokens server-side
Enforce session validation on every authenticated request
Implement centralized session management
Log and monitor account deletion and session revocation events
Notify users when their account is deleted or deactivated





➡️ This confirms that sessions are not invalidated after account deletion.
