The application does not invalidate previously generated password reset links after a user changes and verifies their email address.
As a result, an old password reset link remains valid and can still be used to change the account password, even after the account email has been updated.
This behavior allows attackers who obtain an old reset link to take over the account, despite changes made to secure it.



                                                                               
                                                                                 Steps to Reproduce




1.Initiate a password reset request for the account.

2.Receive the password reset email.

3.Do not open the reset link; instead, copy and save the link.

4.Log in to the account normally.

5.Navigate to Account Settings / Account Overview.

6.Go to Email & Password Settings.

7.Change the registered email address and complete email verification.

8.After successfully changing the email, open the previously copied password reset link.

9.Reset the password using the old link.

10.Observe that the password is successfully changed.

➡️ This confirms that the reset link was not invalidated after the email change.

An attacker can: Reuse an old password reset link
                Take over a user account after email change
                Bypass account recovery protections
                Maintain unauthorized access
              Defeat user attempts to secure the account



                                                                                       Remediation





Invalidate all password reset tokens after: Email address change
                                            Password change
                                            MFA enablement

Enforce short expiration times for reset links

Bind reset tokens to: User identity
                      Email address

Allow only one active reset token per user

Notify users when: Email is changed
                  Password reset is requested

Log and monitor reset token usage
