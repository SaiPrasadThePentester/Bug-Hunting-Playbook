1. Title
Purpose:Provide a clear and concise title that immediately identifies the vulnerability type and affected component.
Example: SQL Injection in Login Endpoint of example.com

2. Domain (Optional)
Purpose:Specify the affected domain and confirm it is within the authorized scope.
Example:example.com

3. Endpoint (Optional)
Purpose:Identify the specific path or resource where the vulnerability exists.
Example:/login

4. Vulnerability Type
Purpose:Classify the vulnerability using a standardized naming convention.
Example:SQL Injection

5. Vulnerable Parameter
Purpose:Identify the specific parameter affected by the vulnerability.
Example:username

6. Summary
Purpose:Provide a high-level overview explaining how the vulnerability was identified and what type of attack it enables.
Example:The login page is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to improper sanitization of user input in the username parameter. An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to bypass authentication and extract sensitive database information.

7. Proof of Concept (PoC)
Purpose: Demonstrate reproducibility with clear steps, payloads, and requests.

8. Steps to Reproduce:
Open the login page: https://example.com/login
Enter the following payload in the username field:

' OR 1=1--


Enter any random password.
Submit the request and observe successful authentication bypass.

Request Example:
POST /login
username=' OR 1=1--
password=random

8. Impact
Purpose: Explain the business and security risks resulting from exploitation.
Example: An attacker can bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to user accounts, extract sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire database.

9. CVSS Score: 9.0 (Critical – CVSS v3.x)

10. Remediation
Purpose:Provide clear and actionable mitigation steps.
Use prepared statements or parameterized queries, validate and sanitize all user inputs, and implement proper error handling to prevent SQL query manipulation
